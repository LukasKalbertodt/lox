//! Types and functions related to handles (e.g. face handle, vertex handle).
//!
//! A handle is some kind of identifier which allows you to retrieve the data
//! associated with that handle. It's a bit like the key in a hashmap. There
//! are different kinds of handles to refer to different data. For example, a
//! `FaceHandle` can be used to retrieve a face.
//!
//! Note that different kinds of handles usually only exist to use strong
//! typing and are identical on machine level. This allows you to get a
//! compiler error when you pass a `VertexHandle` where a `FaceHandle` is
//! expected. Without strong handle types, it's easy to get very strange and
//! hard to debug runtime errors.
//!
//! # IDs and `DefaultInt`
//!
//! Handles are built around IDs. Usually, a handle type simply stores the id
//! and functions as a (strongly typed) wrapper. An ID is just data that is
//! able to uniquly identify with other data. However, the ID does not need to
//! be globally unique, but only in a specific *universe* (like a mesh).
//!
//! The last paragraph sounds like an ID is pretty abstract, but in fact, right
//! now, there is only one ID type: `u32`.
//!
//! It is planned to make this library generic over the ID type, but sadly,
//! this makes large parts of the API a lot more complicated. Additionally,
//! without the "GAT" feature of Rust, many things are not really possible. So
//! for now, `u32` is the ID type used everywhere. This choice is probably
//! absolutely OK for most uses cases. See the documentation of `DefaultInt` for
//! more details.

/// The integer used in all handle types. See [the module documentation][self]
/// for more information on IDs.
///
/// Since we can't be generic over the ID type right now (as explained in [the
/// module documentation][self]), we have to choose a good default. `u32` is
/// fitting for most use cases.
///
/// Since the ID is always used to refer to some data, exhausting `u32` means
/// that we have more than 2<sup>32</sup> instances of that data. If one
/// instance is only 1 byte big, this results in 4GB memory usage. However, in
/// practice 1 byte is not enough to store anything useful for meshes. Usually,
/// you at least store some kind of position (e.g. `[f32; 3]` = 12 bytes) per
/// vertex plus the connectivity information, which is at something like 3
/// handles per face. So the useful minimum of stored information is:
///
/// - 12 bytes per vertex
/// - 12 bytes per face
///
/// From [here][1] we can see that in a typical triangular mesh, there are
/// around twice as many faces as vertices. The effective size per face is thus
/// around 18 bytes. To have more than 2<sup>32</sup> faces, the mesh would
/// occupy around 2<sup>32</sup> Â· 18 bytes = 72 GB of memory. In other data
/// structures that store more connectivity information, this would be even
/// more. There do exist rare situations (mostly in research) where one has to
/// deal with huge meshes of that size. But again, it's rather rare.
///
/// On the other side are use cases where a smaller ID type, like `u16` would
/// be sufficient. Here, one could save memory by using a smaller ID type.
/// Making `u16` the default ID type is not OK though: 2<sup>16</sup> = 65536
/// is not a huge number and there are many situations in which meshes have way
/// more than 65536 elements.
///
