# Old code

This is code that used to live one directory up.
However, in order to finally release this crate, I made the decision to reduce the scope of this library.
This meant throwing out all IO related code.
While important and very useful, it was just too much extra complexity, so it is not in the initial release.

I could of course just delete everything as it's preserved by git.
I decided to instead keep the code in this folder for convenience.

I hope that one day I'll be able to add all of this back!
